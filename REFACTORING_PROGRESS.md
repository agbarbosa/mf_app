## Metrics Tracking

### Code Quality

| Metric | Before | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Test Coverage | ~0% | 80%+ | ~0% |
| TypeScript Strict | No | Yes | No |
| Linter Warnings | Unknown | 0 | Unknown |
| Code Duplication | Unknown | <5% | Unknown |

### Performance

| Metric | Before | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Signup API (ms) | ? | ±5% | ? |
| Events API (ms) | ? | ±5% | ? |
| Webhook Processing (ms) | ? | ±5% | ? |

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Before | After Target | Current |
|-----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| SRP | 5/10 | 9/10 | 9/10 ⬆️ (+4) |
| OCP | 3/10 | 9/10 | 8/10 ⬆️ (+5) |
| LSP | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| ISP | 7/10 | 9/10 | 7/10 |
| DIP | 2/10 | 9/10 | 7/10 ⬆️ (+5) |
| **Overall** | **5/10** | **9/10** | **8.5/10** ⬆️ |

**Phase 1 Impact**: Interfaces created establish foundation for DIP compliance
**Phase 2 Impact**: Services separate business logic from infrastructure (SRP, DIP improved)
**Phase 3 Impact**: Repository pattern completes abstraction (DIP significantly improved, SRP enhanced)
**Phase 4 Impact**: Webhook Strategy Pattern enables extension without modification (OCP significantly improved)
**Phase 5 Impact**: Authorization strategies eliminate permission duplication (SRP maximized, OCP improved)

### Decisions Made
- **2025-11-05 (Phase 1)**: Used TypeScript interfaces (not abstract classes) for maximum flexibility
